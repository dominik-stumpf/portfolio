    Hello! My name is Dominik Stumpf. I'm a fullstack web developer, video game
    maker and almost a scientist.

  <p>
    I am the creator of a posting platform prototype called <a href="/"
      >PostPaper</a
    >. I love fiddling around with computer graphics, game development that
    usually involves math and Rust. Also I recently started writing blogs about
    tech you can check out here. Most of the work I do in my freetime is
    open-source and available on my GitHub just like the page you are viewing.
